# Introduction
The IAB has organized a workshop (June 4-June 6, 2002) to establish a dialog between network operators and protocol developers, and to
guide the IETF focus on work regarding network management. The outcome of that workshop was documented in the "IAB Network
Management Workshop" (RFC3535) that identified 14 requirements that the operators wanted to see in the next generation of management

Those requirements were instrumental for developing first the NETCONF protocol (in the NETCONF Working Group), then YANG data modeling language
(in the NETMOD Working Group), and finally RESTCONF. 

This IAB workshop should look at whether those requirements been met, and more importantly gather input on what are some of the new requirements the operators are facing, with the final idea to understand what the IETF should be focusing on.

# Current Implementation
Taking into account the RFC 3535 requirements, what does the implementation look like today? If there are hurdles towards implementation, what are they?
Do operators think that specifications are missing for the requirements? 

# New Requirements

More than 20 years later, it's also time to brainstorm on next generation of management, as new requirements on network management operations are emerging
from the operators. This workshop intends to identify and discuss these requirements.  

For example, there is a strong desire to automate network management. What are we missing that will enable that automation?

Artifical Intelligence (AI) has placed requirements on network management. What are some of those requirements?

# Tooling and Libraries

Part of the problem with adoption could be related towards availability of tools and libraries. Are we missing tools that will enable adoption and automation? Are we missing sample implementations or libraries that customers can use “out-of-the” box? Should such implementations appear
in public sources like Sonic or FRR? 

# A minimum set

Would it help to identify a set of models that belong to a YANG library that are known to work together?
What will constitute a minimal set of models that should be known to work together? 

# What this workshop would not cover
- encryption in operator environments
- what else?

# Outreach
In 2002, there were enough operators attending IETF meetings. Those numbers have dwindled over time, with some of the operators attending conferences that are more operator focused. These include RIPE, NANOG, AutoConn etc.

As such the IAB may have to do an outreach effort to get the input they are looking for. A tentative plan is to target these conferences in the October/November 2024 timeframe, and virtual workshops, followed by a final virtual calls tentatively in December to discuss the findings. 
Note: "tentatively" as the key metric for success is the collection of enough feedback, from enough diverse horizons.
